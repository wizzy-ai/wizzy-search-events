# Wizzy_Events module for Magento2

Wizzy_Events is a boilerplate module that allows developers to override events and modify product data before synchronization by [Wizzy_Search](https://github.com/wizzy-ai/wizzy-search-magento-2).

Developers can listen to specific events triggered by Wizzy_Search and make necessary modifications to the product data without modifying the core files of the Wizzy_Search module.

This ensures that future upgrades and updates to the Wizzy_Search module can be easily applied without the risk of losing customizations.

# List of the Events defined in the Wizzy_Events module

1. wizzy_after_products_mapped
2. wizzy_before_product_skip_check
3. wizzy_after_product_categories_generated

# Short Discription for the Events

1. wizzy_after_products_mapped:-

The wizzy_after_products_mapped event is a crucial event provided by the Wizzy_Search module.It allows developers to modify the mapped data of products in the Wizzy_Events module after the mapping process.

2. wizzy_before_product_skip_check:-

By listening to this event, developers can access and modify the product data, preventing the product from being skipped during the synchronization process. This event provides an opportunity to apply custom logic or make necessary adjustments to ensure that all relevant products are included in the sync, even if they would have been skipped based on default criteria.

This flexibility ensures that important products are not inadvertently excluded from the synchronization, enabling accurate and comprehensive search results.
